\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}
\todo{This was initially a chapter in the report, but as it came to be somewhat a presentation of the motivation for the project, we moved it to the introduction. It is not finished as it is, but the general idea is there. More to come!}

Traditionally, programming have been seen as a specialized skill, only relevant for people who work on developing new software.
While several attempts are made at making languages more accessible to everyone \todo{reference logo and probably some more}, they ultimately failed to get enough widespread use to change this perception.
As a result, programming education has been targeted towards college or university students and often had a focus on teaching the student to use professional programming languages like Java\todo{can probably use source about the widespread use of Java here}.
The goal here is to create competent software engineers with the ability to work with powerful tools on complicated software.

In recent years, programming is starting to be seen as an essential skill for living in our modern digital society.
This has lead to many countries making programming a mandatory subject in primary schools. In this setting, the education is more focused on giving children an idea of what it is like to work on software and to teach more generic skills, such as problem solving and collaborative communication. This leads to this education usually being given in visual educational languages like Scratch \todo{JAIS: Scratch has not been mentioned here. Should it?} for their intuitiveness and simplicity.

Of course \todo{JAIS: never start a paragraph with a sentence that's connected to the previous paragraph} this means that the two educations \todo{JAIS: What two educations?} differ in what they teach.
First, the difference in programming languages, as to between being taught an educational language and a professional language. While the educational language has the advantage of being intuitive, it does not have the expressiveness and robustness for large projects that professional languages have.
Second, the computer science education needs to cover a lot of topics to give a sufficient understanding to work professionally with software, where the kids education leaves out a lot of the topics, although this may vary between teachers.
Using the list of topics from "What do Teachers Teach in Introductory Programming?"[bottom link] as a reference, we can for example say that topics like algorithm design and debugging are likely to be taught in the kids education. Meanwhile, topics like algorithm efficiency, pointers and object oriented programming are usually left out.

Kids now being taught programming in primary school is great for the general digital literacy of people, but the education can not teach everything necessary to do professional programming.
We want to work with teaching the skills for professional programming using the already taught knowledge from primary school.
To do this we first need to establish what level people have after working in the educational language and what knowledge is needed to work professionally with programming.
This paper aims to do this as well as suggesting some ideas for ways to bridge that gap.

\todo{JAIS: Should we mention the problem with who is actually teaching the kids in primary school? There is a problem in Denmark, as it is the physics teacher, as far as I know.}
\todo{JAIS: We need some more stuff here, perhaps chapters or sections. Such as Preliminaries and a section where we mention the initial problems.}
