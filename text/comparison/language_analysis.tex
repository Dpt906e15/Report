\chapter{Language Analysis}
\label{chap:language_analysis}
To get a better idea of the landscape of educational programming languages, we are going to compare three popular educational languages.
The three languages are: Scratch, BlueJ and Dr. Racket.
These three languages are chosen as popular learning environments for languages of each their paradigm.
Scratch represents an imperative paradigm, BlueJ an object-oriented paradigm and DrRacket a functional paradigm.

In this chapter, a subjective analysis is made for each of the mentioned languages individually. The procedure used for the analysis is as follows: First, some tasks have been made which are implemented in the different environments/languages. Then each language is analysed individually using the implementations of the tasks, where the analysis is based on the criteria presented in \chapref{chap:criteria}. Finally, the analyses are used to compare the languages and environments. The goal of this analysis is to get an insight into what each paradigm has to offer regarding educational programming and their environment and how they compare. Furthermore, we wish to compare the most common of the educational tools, to find out what their strengths and weaknesses are. This is done for inspirational purposes, giving the possibility of furthering this analysis.

The tasks are made to get as good an overview of the languages as possible. They will sometimes hypothetically favour a certain paradigm over the other, but this is done on purpose to try and find possible problems with the languages. The tasks that are implemented in each of the languages are:
\begin{description}[style=nextline]
\item[Task 1: Iterator] This task is to create a list of a certain size, which is filled with random numbers between 0 and 19, and to create a function which adds a number to every other element in the list. The purpose of this task is to get an example of how lists are made and iterated through in the different languages, which also will give an idea of how the languages are structured in general.
\item[Task 2: Fibonacci Sequence] This task is to implement an algorithm which calculates numbers of the Fibonacci sequence limited by an input by a user. The purpose of this task is to see how an ``introductory'' algorithm can be implemented in each language. It is also to have a task that somewhat favours the functional paradigm, as the functional paradigm is meant to be a way to express math in a programmatic way.
\item[Task 3: Cups and Ball] This task is to create a game where a ball is hidden under one of 15 cups, and the goal is to locate the ball. The purpose is to have a task that hypothetically favours object oriented languages, and to see how this is coped with in a non-object oriented language. Two of the three environments/languages does not support graphics as such, so there will be a difference in how this task is handled in between the languages.
\item[Task 4: Hangman] This task is to create a hangman game, where the user is supposed to guess a word with only a set amount of wrong guesses. The purpose of this task is to have a larger piece of software as the previous tasks are quite small in a sense. This will hypothetically favour Scratch and BlueJ over DrRacket, as the functional paradigm is not really meant for this sort of task.
