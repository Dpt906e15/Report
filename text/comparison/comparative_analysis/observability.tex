\section{Observability}
\label{sec:observability}
In terms of observability Scratch is the best of the three languages.
The visual feedback allows for a greater range of feedback, that can still be intuitively read, for example by showing the motion of a sprite rather than just the endpoint.
The ability to simply click on a code block to run it and see the results also makes the code to feedback time really small.
On the second place we have DrRacket.
It only requires a click for compilation and sometimes a function call, where BlueJ requires instantiation of an object as well.
BlueJ also require the user to add print statements to get feedback from the functions, where DrRacket will automatically print the return value.
