\section{Observability}
\label{sec:observability}
In terms of observability Scratch is the best of the three languages.
The visual feedback allows for a greater range of feedback, that can still be intuitively read.
The ability to simply click on a code block to run it and see the results also makes the code to feedback time really small.
On the second place we have DrRacket.
It only requires a click for compilation and sometimes a function call, where BlueJ requires instantiation of an object as well.
