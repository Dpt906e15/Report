\section{Learnability}
\label{sec:learnability}
Scratch is the clear winner in learnability.
The list of operations both serve to give some suggestions for actions, and helps give an overview of the possible actions.
This is something both DrRacket and BlueJ lack, as the textual coding interface requires the user to have an idea of how the syntax and semantics work before they can make anything.
This means that they both rely on some additional instruction, either through an instructor or a tutorial, before the user can start working.
Neither of the two provide an in-environment tutorial like Scratch.
