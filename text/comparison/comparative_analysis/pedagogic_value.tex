\section{Pedagogic Value}
\label{sec:pedagogic_value}
Each of the languages/environments provides pedagogic values for different aspects of programming. Scratch provides it for basic low level concepts, but has a possible shortcoming in the sense that a user do not have access to some of the functionality Scratch provides, when moving on to a text based programming language which might confuse them. BlueJ does not provide a lot regarding basic concepts of programming, but provide a lot of tools to get an understanding of how classes and objects works. DrRacket provide pedagogic value in the sense that it can provide an understanding of the underlying functionalities in programming languages. An example of this is that in a lot of programming languages, the user will use the expression $2+2$ to get the value $4$, possibly assuming that it ``just works'', where DrRacket shows that using the $+$ operator is a function call in itself.
