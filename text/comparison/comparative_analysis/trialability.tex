\section{Trialability}
\label{sec:trialability}
In terms of trialability Scratch wins again albeit not as much.
Its quick feedback-loop and the decomposable execution are great factors for trialability, but its lack of a slower runtime evaluation mode hurts it a bit.
DrRacket and BlueJ are very close, with both of them highlighting the error code on encounter amongst other features.
DrRacket only wins here on account of being an instantiation of objects shorter than BlueJ in its feedback-loop.
