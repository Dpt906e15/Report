\section{Reusability}
\label{sec:reusability}
Both BlueJ and DrRacket have good features supporting reusability, both supporting classes and objects. Although, BlueJ is a little ahead of DrRacket in this criteria as it is using an object-oriented programming language which possesses a great deal of features for reusing code through abstraction. This fits well with the definition of the criteria shown in \secref{chap:criteria}. Even as DrRacket has support for classes and objects, it is not the main focus of the language which places it a bit behind BlueJ. Scratch has limited features supporting this criteria with its cloning of sprites and function definitions, lacking features for abstraction.
