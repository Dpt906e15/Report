\chapter{Comparative Analysis}
\label{chap:comparative_analysis}

The individual analysis will be taken into account, as all of the languages and environments are compared against each other. If one of these has a clear advantage in a criteria, it will be mentioned as being the best of the chosen to fulfil that criteria, based on our subjective opinions.
