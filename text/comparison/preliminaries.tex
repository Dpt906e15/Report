\chapter{Preliminaries}
\label{chap:preliminaries}
To get a better idea of the landscape of educational programming languages, we are going to compare three popular educational languages.
The three languages are: Scratch, BlueJ and Dr. Racket.
These three languages are chosen as the most popular languages of each their paradigms \todo{probably need to find a source for such a claim}.
Scratch represents an imperative paradigm, BlueJ an object-oriented paradigm and Dr. Racket a functional paradigm.
To do this we will first define some criteria to compare the languages on, after which we will subjectively analyse the languages to get a comparison.
