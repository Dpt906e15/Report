\chapter{Programming Languages and Tools}
\label{chap:languages_and_tools}

With the growing distribution of computers and mobile devices (such as laptops, smart phones, tablets etc.), the need of programming languages and tools to operate on these machines becomes more and more relevant. Using such tools and languages efficiently, however, often requires much skill and technical aptitude, which in turn takes considerable time and dedication to develop. From the perspective of novice programmers, programming can be extremely hard and overwhelming to get into, especially if they are given no introductory tools and guidance.\\\\
This chapter focuses on the distinction between visual and text based programming languages, analysis of both categories as well as some notable examples. Additionally, these categories are further explored by means of how well they fit in an educational setting.
