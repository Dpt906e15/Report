\section{Teaching Programming}
Traditionally programming have been seen as an engineering discipline.
As a result programming education has been targeted towards college or university students and often had a focus on teaching the student to use professional programming languages like Java.

%A study from 2006 found that a lot of teaches value the topics of selection and iteration, simple data structures (arrays), parameters and scope for introductory programming. Meanwhile topics like efficiency of algorithms, advanced data structures and recursion was not prioritized. 

%The study also found that many teachers teach object-oriented programming in their introductory course.

However in recent years programming is starting to be seen as an essential skill for living in our modern digital society.
This has lead to many countries making programming a mandatory subject in primary schools.
In this setting the education is more focused on giving children an idea of what it is like to work on software.

%To do this it is important to make programming more intuitive and responsive. An example of one is Scratch.

I'm not the only one worried that programming is hard and should be made easier in general
