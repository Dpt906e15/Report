Teaching Programming

Traditional programming education has often had a focus on teaching the student to use professional programming languages like Java and has been targeted towards students.
A study from 2006 found that a lot of teaches value the topics of selection & iteration, simple data structures (arrays), parameters and scope for introductory programming. Meanwhile topics like efficiency of algorithms, advanced data structures and recursion was not prioritized. 

The study also found that many teachers teach object-oriented programming in their introductory course.

It is becoming more popular to teach programming to school kids. To do this it is important to make programming more intuitive and responsive. An example of one is Scratch.


I'm not the only one worried that programming is hard and should be made easier in general
